# Prodigy
I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed the development of a responsive landing page(Task-1) for an Internship of Web Development to ProdigyInfoTech ! ðŸŽ‰

Project Highlights:

ðŸ”¹ HTML Structure:

Designed a clean and semantic HTML structure including essential sections: Header, Home, About, Internships, and Contact.
ðŸ”¹ CSS Styling:

Crafted a visually appealing design with a fixed navigation bar and hover effects for an enhanced user experience.
Implemented unique background colors for each section to ensure clear visual separation.
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript Interactivity:

Added a dynamic scroll effect that changes the navigation bar's background color as users scroll through the page.
Ensured smooth scrolling behavior for a seamless browsing experience.
